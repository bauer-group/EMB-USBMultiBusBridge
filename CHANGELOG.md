# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Four components version independently: **protocol** (RPBP), **firmware**,
**driver**, **userspace** — the top-level release tag pins compatible
combinations.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Repository scaffolding: firmware (pico-sdk pinned to `2.1.1`), Linux C
  driver skeleton (auxiliary_bus-based), Rust userspace workspace, mkdocs
  documentation site, CI workflow scaffolds.
- Initial ADR set (protocol choice, driver bus choice, language split).
- `.gitattributes`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitmodules`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SECURITY.md` per BAUER GROUP standards.

### Notes
- This changelog starts when the repository transitions from design-draft
  stage to implementation stage. The design drafts that led to this
  structure are preserved under [`docs/drafts/`](docs/drafts/).
